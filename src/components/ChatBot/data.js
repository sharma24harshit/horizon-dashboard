        question: "What were the top-selling products last month?",
        answer: `
As of January 2025, I don't have access to real-time data. However, I can provide insights into some of the top-selling product categories on Amazon based on trends over the past few years. These often include:

1. Electronics:
   - Smart speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Nest.
   - Wireless earbuds (e.g., Apple AirPods, Bose).
   - Laptops and tablets (e.g., Apple MacBook, Microsoft Surface).
   - Smartwatches and fitness trackers (e.g., Fitbit, Garmin, Apple Watch).
   - Streaming devices (e.g., Amazon Fire Stick, Roku).

2. Books:
   - Bestselling fiction and non-fiction titles.
   - Kindle e-books.

3. Home and Kitchen:
   - Instant Pots and other kitchen gadgets.
   - Robotic vacuum cleaners (e.g., Roomba).
   - Air fryers, blenders, and coffee makers.

Amazon's best sellers frequently shift due to seasonal trends, promotions, and new product releases. You can check out the "Amazon Best Sellers" page for the most up-to-date listings.
